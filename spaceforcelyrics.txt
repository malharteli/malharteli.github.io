At the abyss we stare, we shout we scream
To prove that we are more than a dream
We are (we are) We are (we are)
We are the pioneers of the sky

We'll punch out the stars, 
Wearing all these scars 
We are (we are) We are (we are)
We are all that remains of light



See no evil, feel no pain
Don't get up, we'll break you again
Gnarled your snarl and hollow your tears
Bones will break while you doth shriek
