			<p>In this piece, I acted as the artist on a team of film students. We were given a pre-designated script, and had to create our own take on the lines, and what they involved. As the sole artist, I had to create an animatic that took into account lighting and placement. Fortunately, we had a number of tools on hand, and together my team created a proper layout for the office this conversation would take place in, and rendered it through Google Sketchup. This, combined with my character stills, enabled us to create an interesting scene with just a few lines of conversation.</p>

			<p>The Northeastern University Animation program would often start students off in a course that allowed them to explore the various methodologies behind animation's history. One of the biggest forms of this animation is stop-motion animation. For this exercise, teams were assigned a PSA topic and were allowed to take whatever direction they wanted with it. My team was fortunate enough to have a location on hand that we could easily fit to our needs. As principal photographer, I had to establish each element of the shot, frame our actors in a manner that communicated both emotion and position, and then guide the team through each frame. In addition to this, I had to also ensure that the lighting was consistant throughout the filming process, so that post-processing would not consume the rest of our night.</p>

		<h1>Arcanum Animatic</h1>

			<p>This is a scene I've been workshopping for a personal project. The idea stemmed from a simple question: "What does the word 'Magic' mean to you?" I ended up using the question as a framing device for a wide variety of characters, two of which are represented in the animatic above. For this project, I created everything, though the dialogue was tweaked with help from friends. The goal behind this piece is to communicate as much through body language as through dialogue. Emotions like anger, frustration, relaxation and sarcasm inhabit a wide variety of physical movements, so it was interesting to explore what I was capable of with my new tablet. Another really important thing I really wanted to try was developing a relationship with light and dark. The scene slowly transfers from day to night, and with the black and white palette I chose, I tried finding more ways to communicate this transition.</p>
