The Player is in a room with at least a yoga mat on the ground, and is holding a plank position. There is an exercise bar above the player that fills up as the player mashes [PUSH-UP], which makes the player do a push up. Doing this rapidly decreases the [BREATH], [HUNGER], [ENERGY], [HYGIENE] gauges. The bar will remain at the same point if you decide to stop and resume later midway through.
If the bar fills the whole way, the game will pause, and two options will appear: [UPGRADE SKILL] & [DECREASE DECAY RATE]. If you click on the former, you then have the option to click on any of the automatic skills, such as [AUTOMATED BREATHING] or [UTENSIL MASTER]. Clicking on the later will then highlight the gauges on the left half of the screen, and clicking on one will slow the rate at which that gauge depletes. The game resumes immediately after either action is performed.
