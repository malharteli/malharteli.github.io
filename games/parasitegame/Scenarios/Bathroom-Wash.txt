The player is sitting in a large bathtub, with just their head sticking out. Mashing [SCRUB] will cause the player to scrub, increasing the [HYGIENE] gauge. Clicking the [SUBMERGE] button will cause the player to dunk their whole head in, which raises their hygiene without needing to scrub, and scrubbing will raise their hygiene even faster. However, this will also lower the [BREATH] gauge and disable automatic breathing. The player can emerge from the water just by clicking the submerge button again.
