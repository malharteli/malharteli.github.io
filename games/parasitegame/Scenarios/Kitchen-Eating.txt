The player is sitting down at a kitchen table with a big bowl of non-identifiable food. The first option, [FACEPLANT] aptly toggle the player to stick their face right in the food. This will slowly decrease [BREATH] and [HYGIENE] gaugeS. While faceplanting, the player has the option to [SWALLOW] and, once unlocked, [CHEW]. 
The player can continuously swallow food to replenish the [HUNGER] gauge, but swallowing has the chance to can cause the player to choke. This would make them need to come up for air and mash the [GASP] button. Mashing the chewing button will make a bar appear above the player. The more the bar is filled, the better the chance that the player will not choke upon swallowing.
Eventually, the player can unlock [RAISE UTENSIL]. Using this would allow the player to hold onto a utensil for a limited amount of time, greatly decreasing the rate of decay on the gauges. The player will need to re-grab the utensil every time the limit runs out, but the limit can be extended by upgrading the [UTENSIL MASTER] automatic skill.
